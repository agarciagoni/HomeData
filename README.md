# Kitchen-Sensors
Here we include the first codes realted to data gathering from the sensors deployed on the Piccolo Kitchen Project:
https://www.media.mit.edu/projects/piccolo-kitchen/overview/

At the moment the sensors we are using include:

   - Ultrasonic Sensor Y401
   - VL53L0X distance_sonic sensor
   - Sound sensor SEN-12642 x1
   - PIR sensor x1
   - Buttons x5 ( 3 backside,2 upper cabinet left)
   - terMITes x1 (Measuring Temperature, Humidity and Light)
   
   The arduino code is set to gather the data from the sensor
   Python scripts save the data into csv format to be used for future analysis and visualisation.
   
   As more sensors are included, the codes will be updated.
